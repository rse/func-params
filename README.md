About
-----

This is a tiny JavaScript function for determining the names of the
parameters of a function under run-time. It can be used as the building
block for Dependency Injection or Named-Parameter implementations.
The underlying problem is that there is no official JavaScript API
to determine the names of the parameters of a function under run-time,
except the ECMAScript 2015 `Function.prototype.toString()`. This
library determines the names of the function parameters by parsing
the source code of `Function.prototype.toString()`. Its parsing is not
100%, but is able to handle even complex syntax scenarios.

Installation
------------

```shell
$ npm install func-params
```

Usage
-----

```js
const funcParams = require("func-params")

/*  simple example  */
funcParams(function (a, b, c, d) {})
// --> [ "a", "b", "c", "d" ]

/*  complex example  */
funcParams(function (
    a /* x,y */ = /* x,y */ `foo\`baz${bar + ",)" + (42 / 7)}bar`,
    b = x(42, 7),
    c = { foo: { bar: x(42, 7), baz: [ 2 / 3 ] } },
    d = 42
) {})
// --> [ "a", "b", "c", "d" ]
```
